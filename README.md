# Mediation Analysis in R
Thank you very much for reading this article to the end. I would be delighted if this post has been of any help to you. 

As someone who studies statistics, including structural equation modeling, on a daily basis, I keenly feel that there is still much for me to learn.

In this article, I have attempted to explain mediation analysis as clearly as possible. There may have been parts that were difficult to understand.

If so, please don't hesitate to ask questions. I would be very grateful if you could point out any areas where the explanations or code could be improved or corrected.

As someone who is constantly learning about structural equation modeling and related statistical techniques, I'm always looking to expand my knowledge. 

If you know of any books, papers, or websites that would be helpful for studying structural equation modeling, in addition to the references listed below, I would greatly appreciate your recommendations.

Your feedback and suggestions are invaluable in helping me improve this resource. Thank you for your interest and support!
